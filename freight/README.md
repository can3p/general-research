# Freight

We're all used to the fact that things can be produced in one part of the world
and consumed in a very different one. A question that naturaly comes up is how
is this all handled?

One of the major brakthroughs in the 20th century was an [invention][1] of standard
container. To be precise not container by itself but it's standard size - 1 and 2 TEU,
which are the most widespread in the world. Why is it important? Because all means
of transport were optimized to handle this type of containers which resulted in a
dramatic increase of amount of cargo transfered.

![Here is 2 TEU][2]
